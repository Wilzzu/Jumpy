# Jumpy

Challenging 2D platformer game that requires precision and patience. Built with Unity for both desktop and mobile.

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** Reach the goal at the top of the level.
- **Controls:**
  - **Spacebar / Tap:** Stops the rotating indicator and sets the jump direction.
  - **Spacebar / Tap (again):** Stops the force indicator and jumps with the set power.
  - **B / Magnifying glass icon**: Zoom in and out.
  - **ESC / Door icon:** Pause the game.
- **Mechanics:**

  - The character will bounce around after jumping. Once it stops, you can jump again.
  - Zoom in and out to see the level better.

- Be careful! One missed jump, and you'll be plummeting back to the start.
